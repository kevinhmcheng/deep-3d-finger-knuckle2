# Advancing 3D Finger Knuckle Recognition via Deep Feature Learning [1]


This package provides the implementation codes for reproducing the experimental results presented in this paper [1]. This package also re-implements the baseline method presented in reference [2].

This package is tested using a computer system: with Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS and Pytorch 1.11.0.


## Detail steps:
1. Train/Test baseline methods and the FKNet+.
-Execute main.ipynb Jupyter notebook.

2. Visualize the recognition performances.
-Execute matlab/ROC_model_select.m using MATLAB.
